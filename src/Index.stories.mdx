# Get Started

`react-gadgets` is a custom reusable react component library that helps to set up react applications quickly. Most of the components were created as we needed them. This library will not be actively maintained but feel free to provide some feedbacks / issues / pull request for new components to help others.

## Storybook Usage

Refer to the Samples for a rough idea on how to use storybook. **TLDR:**
- **In Canvas Tab** -- contains the component for user to interact with
    - **Story Tab** -- source code for the story
    - **Action Tab** -- logs the actions/events triggered
- **In Doc Tab** -- contains documentation on how to use the component
    - Note that this documentation is automatically generated with minimal edits.

## Library Usage

Note that for some of the components, it is necessary to import the **css files**! Refer to the documentation for more information.

## Development

For development, refer to the project documentations for more information.
